AMBIENT LIGHT SYSTEM

This project presents the design and implementation of a versatile ambient lighting system using RGB LEDs, controlled wirelessly through a mobile application. The system is built around an Arduino Uno microcontroller, with an emphasis on minimizing hardware complexity by employing the PCA9685 module to control multiple RGB LEDs using the I2C communication protocol. This approach reduces the need for a large number of GPIO pins, making the design more scalable and efficient.The primary objective is to allow users to adjust the lighting parameters, including color, brightness, and special effects like breathing and blinking effects, in real-time via Bluetooth communication. The HC-05 Bluetooth module facilitates the wireless link between the mobile application and the microcontroller. The app provides an intuitive user interface where users can easily customize their ambient lighting setup to suit various environments, such as home decor, entertainment, or workspaces.Testing and calibration were performed to ensure that the lighting system responded accurately to user inputs, demonstrating stability in wireless communication and smooth transitions in lighting effects. The system offers a user-friendly solution with potential applications in home automation, smart lighting, and personalized decor. It also allows future expansion, including integrating additional LEDs or more advanced features like voice control or WiFi based cloud integration
